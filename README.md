### 🌟 About Me

A curious and motivated computer science undergrad specializing in **Cyber Security & Forensics**, I'm passionate about understanding how secure systems work and how attackers think. I enjoy exploring tools, technologies, and techniques that contribute to a safer digital world.

I interned at **InfoSec Dot** during **June-July 2025**, where I contributed to:
- ✍️ Blog writing
- 📝 Tool guides
- 📄 Research one-pagers
- 🔍 Case studies
- 🛠️ Tool exploration (OSINT, web security)

I'm currently working on strengthening my **core programming** and **practical web security** skills. Every project, every line of code, and every tool I explore brings me a step closer to becoming a skilled security professional.
