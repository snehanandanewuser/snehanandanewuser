## 🌟 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Sneha**, a curious and motivated computer science undergrad specializing in **Cyber Security & Forensics**. I love diving deep into how things work — from secure systems to how attackers think — and I’m continuously exploring tools and technologies that help build a safer digital world.

I’ve recently interned at **InfoSec Dot** under the **SAMARTH Internship Program**, where I contributed to blogs, guides, research one pager, case study and tool exploration in the field of cybersecurity. I'm currently working on strengthening my **core programming**, practical **web security skills** and more. Every project, every line of code, and every tool I explore brings me a step closer to becoming a confident and skilled security professional.
